# Power Notes

## About
Power Notes is a note-taking app for iPad that was designed to make your notetaking experience FAST! Lectures can be pretty demanding for those who take handwritten notes, and you would want a note-taking app that can be fast enough to help you speed through your lectures with lightning speed, no matter your writing speed.

Power Notes was designed from the ground up as the middle ground between Goodnotes 6 and Apple Notes, incorporating a native UI built with **SwiftUI**, the expressive and rich ink of **PencilKit**, combined with the powerful page-by-page editing, allowing students to create their own digital notebooks that is easy to organize, and find information quickly.
